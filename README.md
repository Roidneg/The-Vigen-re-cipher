# The-Vigen-re-cipher
Simple cipher that allows for encryption and encryption
# Vigenère Cipher in Python

This Python program implements the Vigenère cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Description

The Vigenère cipher is a classic encryption algorithm that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages. This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenère cipher.

## Features

- Encryption of plaintext messages
- Decryption of encrypted messages
- Customizable key for encryption and decryption

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using `python vigenere_cipher.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the plaintext, key, and choose between encryption and decryption.

## Example

```bash
$ python vigenere_cipher.py

Enter the plaintext: mrttaqrhknsw ih puggrur
Enter the key: python
Choose operation (1 for encryption, 2 for decryption): 1

Encrypted text: wvxnvmbemlgm nb jwfdwuo
